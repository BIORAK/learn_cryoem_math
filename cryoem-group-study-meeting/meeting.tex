\section{General Information}

In just a few days since my message on 3DEM there were over 100 responses to the survey. Below is the plan, which will kick off this upcoming week on {\bf Thursday 19 Nov at 9 AM PST. Dr. Frederick Sigworth will be our special guest for this inaugural meeting.} Now is the time to extend invitations far and wide. Feel free to share this document and direct people to sign up at \url{https://forms.gle/BUeUW14vV4pyQbDDA} so I have the emails in one place. Online meeting link to follow (Zoom). Forgive typographical errors for this document, which I wanted to get out as soon as possible. {\bf Please join the Slack group and ask questions there, rather than emailing me, as there are too many of us and I will be overwhelmed!}

\subsection{Meeting Frequency and Length}
The most popular meeting frequency was every 1-2 weeks (59) followed by once a month (32). We'll hit the ground running and start off every 1-2 weeks. Depending on how things go we way move to once a month. For length the popular times were 60-90 min (47), followed closely by 30-45 min (41). Thus the initial format will be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Every 1-2 weeks
	\item 60-90 min
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Audience and Streams}
Over 2/3 of the audience are grad students. There rest of the audience is a mix of long term staff (13, facility manager, seniour scientist, research associate, unspecified industry position, etc.), principal investigators (4, industry or academic), postdocs (9), and undergraduate (1). After carefully reading the responses, I think it would be best to have two streams each meeting. I have code named them the {\bf blur} and {\bf sharpen} stream, referring to map sharpening. I am counting on your sense of humour and humility for this playful naming schema! Perhaps its a bit more gentle than low and high resolution? Remember that both blurred and sharpened maps are important for being able to see what is going on and build a model in to the map. The goal of this study group is to have both intuition and be able to connect that back to the math, never missing the forest for the trees.

{\bf  Blur stream}: Beginners and intermediates with may have years of expertise doing sample prep, collecting data on the scope, making maps, and building models. However, many people with such expertise expressed a desire to go deeper into the fundamentals, and understand things better under the hood, and requested help to become more confident in the math. One person put it bluntly, "I am interested in being more than a button pusher."

{\bf Sharpen stream}: This stream can be for people with a high degree of expertise that are looking to sharpen their skills, and interact with other experts. For example: methods developers with perhaps not that much experience processing datasets from start to finish, university instructors, facility managers who have a strong working knowledge but want to go deeper into the foundations and refresh, people with strong math and physics backgrounds that are fairly new but will catch on quickly, experts in crystallography that are switching over to cryoEM but that have a strong theoretical basis in the underlying math already.

After reading through the responses a few times, I would estimate the ratio of the streams to be about 3/4 blur to 1/4 sharpen. In the first meeting you can choose your own stream, and go to breakout rooms with this in mind. I will make multiple breakout rooms so that there can be small group discussion of 4-8 people. If you are an expert feel free to go to the blur stream and help out. If you judge yourself an intermediate-beginner, you can test the waters in the sharpen stream. The two stream format may evolve over time (e.g. three streams, a lecture with everyone together), but let's try out two streams and see how it goes.

\subsection{Meeting Format}
We will start with the "flipped classroom" and "breakout room discussions" to get things off the ground with minimal overhead. After some initial meetings we will try out a mix of the following formats listed below, with their surveyed popularity  listed next to them. {\bf If you would like to volunteer to give a lecture or be available for office hours then please send me an email to volunteer yourself.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lecture with Q\&A (72)
	\item Flipped classroom: i.e. we have a syllabus with pre-reading (textbook chapter, review paper) that we go through before and then discuss online (57)
	\item Breakout room discussion (small groups organized thematically) (35)
	\item Office hours with an expert available to answer questions (24)	
\end{itemize}

\section{Meeting Time for a Global Audience}
About 94\% of those interested in North America and Europe (mainly UK and Germany) (85), with the rest in Israel, China, India, Bangladesh, Australia (5). For now we will have the time at 9 AM PST, thus 7 PM in Israel. I am open to proposals to occasionally have a different time to accommodate a global audience - especially if the presenter is from a less represented time zone. I tried this \href{https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html}{online time zone tool} and it didn't suggest anything that worked. Suggestions are welcome for this aspect.

For the first meeting we will meet at 9 AM PST, which is 12 PM EST, 5 PM GMT, 7 PM GMT+2, 1 AM next day GMT+8, 3 AM next day GMT+10.

\section{Organizational Team}
To the question 'Would you like to be part of the organizational team?' 39 people answered maybe and 4 people answered yes.

I would appreciate help 
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Giving lectures. You can send a proposal to me including topic, format, time, date.}
	\item Developing the syllabus, and suggesting (or making) learning content.
	\item Formulating challenge problems to test comprehension, build intuition, and conceptual understanding.
	\item {\bf Being the leader of a breakout room to answer questions. You could list your areas of expertise, so people would know to come to you for those things. A sort of 'office hours'.}
	\item Zoom co-host.
	\item Suggesting improvements to me. You could ask around and see how people are finding things.
\end{itemize}

\section{Slack}
We will use the Slack channel 'cryoem\_study\_group' for asynchronous chat. The link to join is 
{\tiny \url{https://join.slack.com/t/cryoemstudygroup/shared\_invite/zt-j66wuws3-~UcfsdmtQow~7qYC~iJu\_g}}. Please join the Slack group and ask questions there, rather than emailing me, as there are too many of us and I will be overwhelmed!

\section{Syllabus}
We will start off drawing heavily from the content developed by Dr Frederick Sigworth, \url{https://cryoemprinciples.yale.edu/video-lectures}. 

If you haven't already gone through Grant Jensen's \href{https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/grant-jensen-cryo-em}{popular} online course \href{https://jensenlab.caltech.edu/courses/}{'Getting Started in Cryo-EM' }, now would be a good time to do so. I think enough people have gone through this on their own that we will mainly draw from other material.

\item Around the 23-25 min mark of the 'Defocus phase contrast' video the CTF seems to oscillate to zeros. Is this observed in practice? Why or why not?
\item Work through the derivation with pencil and eraser, justifying each step as best you can. come with your questions to the group study.
